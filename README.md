# Smart_Garden

Welcome to the Smart Garden System repository! This project aims to create an intelligent and automated system for managing and monitoring your garden. Whether you're a gardening enthusiast or a beginner, this system will help you optimize plant care and ensure a thriving garden.

Features

-> Automated Irrigation: The Smart Garden System provides automated watering based on plant requirements. It monitors soil moisture levels and activates the irrigation system when necessary, ensuring your plants receive adequate water without waste.

-> Environmental Monitoring: The system tracks environmental parameters such as temperature and humidity. This data is crucial for understanding the optimal growing conditions for your plants. 

-> Monitored Irrigation: The Smart Garden System senses human intervention through sensors. If detected, the irrigation will be halted till the sensor does not sense anything.
